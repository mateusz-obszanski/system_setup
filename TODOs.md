# TODOs:

- prepare `init.vim` that uses `cfg.lua` based on Michal's setup
- move scripts to `scripts` directory
- script arguments
- fix sourcing my_utils.sh
- replace `source` with `.` for somewhat shell compatibility
- config file for full setup (maybe .env) - that will make it fully automatic
- create .zshrc template in ./configs
- deduce scripts' localizations where needed with dirname
- add alias that reads and prints useful desktop shortcuts in less
